# Agent Skills Library

This folder defines modular Agent Skills for Moonshine Capital apps, static sites, Next.js tools, embedded widgets, partner portals, referral funnels, and strategic partner enablement.

These skills are designed to be portable building blocks. A skill should do one job well: triage a lead, explain a result, route a CTA, generate partner copy, map CRM fields, detect risky claims, or turn widget inputs into next actions.

## Intended users

- affiliate partners
- referral partners
- CPAs and bookkeepers
- business brokers and M&A advisors
- real estate investors
- ecommerce sellers
- trucking/logistics operators
- local referral partners
- internal Moonshine Capital operators

## Guardrails

- Do not guarantee funding or approval.
- Do not expose backend funding providers in public-facing skills unless explicitly approved.
- Do not provide legal, tax, credit repair, or financial advice.
- Do not include private client data, secrets, credentials, API keys, or sensitive bank data.
- Keep internal routing logic separate from prospect-facing copy.

## Build priority

Start with the P0 skills in [`top-25-build-priority.md`](top-25-build-priority.md). These power the money path: traffic → widget → lead → triage → partner/referral routing → CRM → follow-up.
